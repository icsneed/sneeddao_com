        <h2>About Sneed DAO</h2>
        <p>A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an organization that is governed by its members. DAOs operate with rules encoded in smart contracts, which removes the need for centralized leadership (e.g., a CEO).</p>
        <p>On the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), decentralized applications (dApps) can be controlled by <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/sns/overview" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">SNS (Service Nervous System) DAOs</a>. SNS DAOs are advanced DAOs that operate entirely on the ICP blockchain, enabling dApp operation and maintenance fully within Web3 through a token-based governance system.</p>
        <p><strong>Sneed DAO</strong> is a fully <strong>community-owned and community-driven</strong> SNS DAO on ICP, emerging from the <a href="https://nuance.xyz/sneeddao/6790-434go-diaaa-aaaaf-qakwq-cai/the-need-for-sneed-a-short-history-of-sneed-dao" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">legacy of SNS-1 (nicknamed "SNEED" by the community)</a>. It was designed as a customizable and open "Blank Canvas" dApp, with the goal of providing a self-sustaining platform for the ICP community to innovate and build. </p>
        <p>Sneed DAO empowers its community members to propose, vote on, and develop any ideas, projects, partnerships, etc. There are no limits set. Sneed DAO aims to be an open and collaborative platform, inviting everyone—from developers and creatives to enthusiasts with ambitious ideas—to join, contribute, and build together.</p>
        
        <h2>What Makes Sneed DAO Special</h2>
        <ul class="special-features">
            <li><strong>Blank Canvas Model: Open Innovation</strong>
                <p>An accessible platform for developers and enthusiasts to collaborate without constraints, free from the focus on a single main product.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Community Governance</strong>
                <p>All decisions are made collectively by token holders, ensuring that the community directs the future of the DAO.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>100% On-Chain Operations</strong>
                <p>All activities are fully decentralized and transparent on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).</p>

                        <p>Reliance on centralized servers can lead to single points of failure, data leaks, and less user control.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Transparency</strong>
                        <p>DAO Operations may not be fully transparent. They may be relying on centralized decision-makers, reducing trust among the community.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Restricted Innovation</strong>

        </div>
        <p>The main vision of Sneed DAO is that its community members shape the future of the DAO using an open-platform "Blank Canvas" approach, which is realized through a straightforward three-step process using the SNEED token:</p>
        <ol class="vision-steps">
            <li><strong>Proposal Submission:</strong> Community developers and members submit proposals for new projects, initiatives, or changes (for example on <a href="https://oc.app/community/aury7-ryaaa-aaaar-auzia-cai/channel/81003719287785947185360149666822395705" target ="_blank">OpenChat</a> or <a href="https://proposals.network/?g=fi3zi-fyaaa-aaaaq-aachq-cai" target ="_blank">Proposals.network)</a>. These proposals are then publicly votable on the <a href="https://nns.ic0.app/proposals/?u=fp274-iaaaa-aaaaq-aacha-cai" target ="_blank">NNS</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>DAO Decision:</strong> SNEED token holders vote on proposals.</li>
            <li><strong>DAO Action:</strong> Approved proposals are implemented, dApp code changes are directly, trustlessly made on-chain via the SNS.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This "Blank Canvas" model stands for an "open call" to the ICP community for any kind of software development. Anyone can submit their proposal to the DAO. The future of Sneed DAO is 100% shaped by its decentralized community, which is in control of the DAO treasury and the DAO dApps.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Since the inception of Sneed DAO in October 2023 and the successful <a href="https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai&proposal=127066" target="_blank">transition</a> to an SNS DAO in January 2024, the community has been actively building on the "Blank Canvas" model. Below are some of the projects developed by the Sneed community so far:</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/icsneed/sneed" target="_blank">Sneed token</a> is an implementation of Dfinity's ICRC1 standard, developed by the Sneed community. It enabled the direct addition of the token logo into the token canister. Since its release in October 2023, many ICP community projects ("memecoins") have forked this code base and used the Sneed ICRC1 standard.</p>

        <p>SneedLock 2.0 allows users (e.g., community token teams) to lock ICRC1 tokens and liquidity pools (LP) for specific durations.</p>
        <p>SneedLock enhances security and trust within the ICP ecosystem by preventing access to locked tokens and/or LPs until the lock expires, helping to mitigate risks like "rug-pulls."</p>
        <p>SneedLock is a modern alternative to "blackholing" LP positions, in which case the LP owners would forfeit claiming the LP rewards forever.</p>
        <p>SneedLock supports an open API for integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on ICP, with a primary focus on <a href="https://sneedlock.com" target="_blank">ICPSwap</a>.</p>
        <p>SneedLock 2.0 is currently in <a href="https://pxtkg-giaaa-aaaal-ajjzq-cai.icp0.io" target="_blank">Beta</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sneed DAO Tokenomics: RLL Model</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="rll-content">
        <div class="rll-description">
            <p>The Recursive Liquidity Loop (RLL) is a model developed by the Sneed SNS DAO as an alternative to inflationary SNS tokens. The governance token of Sneed DAO (SNEED) is non-inflationary, meaning the total supply (10 000 SNEED) will never increase. Here is a short breakdown of how it works:</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. Burning/Distributing SNEED Tokens</strong><br>
            Rewards generated in SNEED tokens from the Sneed DAO Liquidity Pools (LPs) are regularly burned (removed from circulation) and/or distributed to the Sneed DAO governance members. Sneed DAO proposals can change this ratio from 100% burned to 100% distributed. This burn/distribution process is a core part of the DAO's approach to managing the ecosystem because it avoids the issuance of new SNEED tokens.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Staking ICP Rewards</strong><br>
            Rewards earned in ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) coins from the Sneed DAO LPs are staked in an 8-year neuron which is controlled by the DAO. This staking process helps the DAO participate in ICP's governance and earn additional rewards that support the DAO's activities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Distributing Maturity Rewards from Staked ICP</strong><br>
            As the staked ICP tokens generate returns, these are distributed back to the Sneed SNS DAO community as governance rewards. These governance rewards can then be spent on buying-back SNEED tokens and/or on the distribution to Sneed DAO governance members. This approach closes the RLL as buying-back SNEED tokens again generate rewards in Sneed DAO LPs.</p>
            
            <p>The RLL model is designed to minimize token inflation, helping to maintain the integrity of DAO votes and retain DAO self-sustainability. Launch the Sneed DAO dApp to see the RLL model in action!</p>

        <p>The Sneed DAO's <a href="https://toolkit.rem.codes/sns/fp274-iaaaa-aaaaq-aacha-cai/wallet/r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai" target="_blank">Treasury</a> was raised during the <a href="https://nns.ic0.app/project/?project=fp274-iaaaa-aaaaq-aacha-cai" target="_blank">Decentralization Sale</a>.</p>
        <p>The full SNS DAO treasury consists of:</p>
        <ul class="treasury-points">
            <li><strong>SNS DAO ICP Canister:</strong> Holds the ICP raised during the decentralization sale, alongside 16.4% of the SNEED token supply.</li>
            <li><strong>Sneed DeFi Canister:</strong> Holds community tokens and assets locked in the first iteration of SneedLock. Visit the <a href="https://suemn-5aaaa-aaaap-qb62q-cai.icp0.io/sneed-lock" target="_blank">Bitcorn Explorer</a> for more information.</li>
			<li><strong>Sneed DAO 8-yr ICP Neuron:</strong> The DAO furthermore controls an 8-yr neuron which receives the Sneed DAO LP rewards. Furthermore, the Sneed DAO treasury will be partly converted to the 8-yr neuron in the future (alongside the full release of the <a href="#rll">RLL dApp</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sneed DAO decides through <a href="#vision">proposals</a> how treasury funds are managed (e.g., to incubate innovative ideas on ICP).</p>
